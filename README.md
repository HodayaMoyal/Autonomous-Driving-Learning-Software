🚗 MyProject - Stop Sign Detection using YOLO
📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered stop sign detection system using a YOLO model. It captures a frame from a screenshot, processes it,
and sends it to the trained YOLO model (last.pt). If a stop sign is detected, the model returns True, indicating that a stop sign is present in the image.

🔍 How It Works
A screenshot or frame is captured from a video or real-time feed.
The frame is passed into the YOLO model for object detection.
The model analyzes the image and identifies if a stop sign is present.
If detected, the system returns True, which can be used for further decision-making processes.

⚙️ Applications
Autonomous Vehicles: Helps in analyzing traffic signs and improving vehicle responses.
Driver Assistance Systems: Can be used as a warning mechanism for stop sign violations.
Traffic Analysis: Useful for monitoring compliance with traffic regulations.

📂 Model & Training
The project uses a custom-trained YOLO model (last.pt), fine-tuned on stop sign datasets. The model is optimized for accurate and fast detection.

🚀 Future Improvements
Expanding detection capabilities for additional traffic signs.
Enhancing accuracy with more training data.
Integrating real-time video processing for continuous detection.
